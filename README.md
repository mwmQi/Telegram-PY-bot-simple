## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the bot, you will need to have Python 3.12+ and pip installed on your system. You will also need a Telegram bot token, which you can get from the BotFather.

### 1. Set up the project

Once you have the project files, it is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Get Your Bot Token

1.  Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`.
2.  Start a chat with BotFather and send `/newbot`.
3.  Follow the instructions to choose a name and username for your bot.
4.  BotFather will provide you with an API token (a long string of letters and numbers).

### 3. Configure the Bot Token

The bot token can be provided in two ways:

1.  **Environment Variable (Recommended):** Set the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable before running the bot.
    ```bash
    export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
    ```
   
    Replace `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"` with the actual token you received from BotFather.

2.  **Interactive Prompt:** If the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable is not set, the bot will prompt you to enter the token when you run `main.py`.

### 4. Run the Bot

Once you have installed the dependencies and configured the bot token, you can run the bot by executing the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot should now be running and accessible in your Telegram account.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
telegram_bot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ venv/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
```

-   `venv/`: This directory contains the Python virtual environment for the project. It isolates the project's dependencies from the global Python installation, ensuring that the bot runs in a consistent and predictable environment. The `venv` directory is created when you run `python3 -m venv venv` and is activated with `source venv/bin/activate`.
-   `main.py`: The main entry point of the bot, responsible for setting up the application and registering command handlers.
-   `handlers.py`: Contains all the asynchronous functions that handle specific Telegram commands (e.g., `/start`, `/help`, `/joke`).
-   `utils.py`: Contains utility functions and variables used across different parts of the bot, such as logging configuration and `start_time` for uptime calculation.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the bot.

## üì¶ Dependencies

The bot relies on the following Python libraries:

- `python-telegram-bot`: The main library used to interact with the Telegram Bot API.
- `httpx`: A modern and asynchronous HTTP client used for making API requests.
- `wikipedia`: A Python library that makes it easy to access and parse data from Wikipedia.
- `qrcode`: A library for generating QR codes.

All the required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
